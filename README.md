# DBCscanï¼š DNA Barcode based contamination scanner

Test script: python DBCscan.py -i ./test_data/tpa_wgs.DWKX.1.fsa_nt.gz -o ./results

For testing purposes, all databases have just a few records. If you want to analyze your data, you should first download the full database from BOLD and nt database from NCBI. And change the path in config file. Now the nt_test database has no taxid with it, I will fix it later soon
